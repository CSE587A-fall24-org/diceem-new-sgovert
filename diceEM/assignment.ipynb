    "Answer: Tightening the convergene criterion does seem to make the results more accurate, but I'm not sure if it makes them substantially more accurate; it depends on what you're tightening it from. For example, in the case of sample size, I would say that tightening the convergence criterion does make the results substantially more accurate, as you can see that when the number of rolls per trial was increased to 50, the number of draws/trials needed to get the right number consistently had a difference of 650. In comparison, when the required accuracy was changed, the number of iterations didn't change extremely. However, I would say that tightening the criterion leads to more accurate responses."
